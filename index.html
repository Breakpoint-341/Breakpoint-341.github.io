              Ethical Use of Community Funds
            </h5>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Recognize that Project Catalyst is the world's largest decentralized innovation engine, designed to solve real-world challenges and drive the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem. 
              As the treasury fund of the Cardano blockchain, it must be used to support and promote the governance, evolution, success, and dissemination of Cardano.
              The approach to Project Catalyst should be: "What can I contribute to Cardano?" Applicants should formulate their proposals with the intention of significantly contributing to 
              the Cardano ecosystem, requesting only the necessary funds to drive projects that offer tangible and lasting value to the community.
              It is essential to discourage the perception that Catalyst is a source of easy money. All projects must align with Cardano's objectives and be designed to strengthen and develop 
              the ecosystem. Project Catalyst is not a private investment fund for financing projects that do not have a direct and meaningful relationship with Cardano's growth and success.
