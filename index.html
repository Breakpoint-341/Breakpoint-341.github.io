              Ethical Use of Community Funds
            </h5>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Recognize that Project Catalyst is the world's largest decentralized innovation engine, designed to solve real-world challenges and drive the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem. 
              As the treasury fund of the Cardano blockchain, it must be used to support and promote the governance, evolution, success, and dissemination of Cardano.
              The approach to Project Catalyst should be: "What can I contribute to Cardano?" Applicants should formulate their proposals with the intention of significantly contributing to 
              the Cardano ecosystem, requesting only the necessary funds to drive projects that offer tangible and lasting value to the community.
              It is essential to discourage the perception that Catalyst is a source of easy money. All projects must align with Cardano's objectives and be designed to strengthen and develop 
              the ecosystem. Project Catalyst is not a private investment fund for financing projects that do not have a direct and meaningful relationship with Cardano's growth and success.

                      Sala de Café, initiated under the Cardano Catalyst Innovation Fund in July 2021, was originally created 
                      to bridge the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking communities into Cardano and Catalyst Funding. 
                      We host breakout sessions after every town hall to connect these communities and anyone seeking guidance 
                      on Cardano, Blockchain, and Catalyst.
                      Our mission is to make technology accessible to underserved communities and onboard new users to Cardano 
                      and Catalyst, while addressing today's complex challenges. Acting as a guiding beacon for Cardano and 
                      Catalyst projects, Sala de Café offers a platform for the community to voice their opinions and share 
                      their challenges. We've been instrumental in the creation of impactful initiatives like the LATAM Town Hall 
                      and many others.
                      Driven by values such as transparency, empathy, and decentralization, we foster an inclusive environment 
                      for learning and participation. Join us at Sala de Café, where we eliminate language barriers, empower communities, 
                      and drive innovation in the Cardano ecosystem.<br>
                      Join us right after the Catalyst Town Hall every Wednesday @ 5pm UTC <br>

              "One of the missions of the Cardano Confederation is to serve as a compass to ensure that Cardano's governance does not lose its way, 
              as has happened with traditional political communities. To this end, it clearly defines the ethical principles that should guide a 
              governance system. Any individual and/or organization wishing to join the Cardano Confederation must adhere to these ethical principles."
